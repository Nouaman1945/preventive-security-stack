# Preventive Security Stack

An integrated security solution combining **Wazuh**, **MISP** (Malware Information Sharing Platform), and **Logstash**, designed to deliver **real-time threat detection**, **log enrichment**, and **proactive analysis**. This stack forms the basis of a preventive security analysis module, suitable for academic research, SOCs, or cybersecurity lab environments.

## üîç Project Overview

This stack aims to:
- Collect and monitor system logs using **Wazuh**
- Correlate logs and alerts through **Logstash**
- Enrich alerts with threat intelligence from **MISP**
- Provide visibility for potential threats through dashboards

The architecture is containerized using **Docker** to simplify deployment and ensure modularity.
