# Preventive Security Stack

An integrated security solution combining **Wazuh**, **MISP** (Malware Information Sharing Platform), and **Logstash**, designed to deliver **real-time threat detection**, **log enrichment**, and **proactive analysis**. This stack forms the basis of a preventive security analysis module, suitable for academic research, SOCs, or cybersecurity lab environments.

## üîç Project Overview

This stack aims to:
- Collect and monitor system logs using **Wazuh**
- Correlate logs and alerts through **Logstash**
- Enrich alerts with threat intelligence from **MISP**
- Provide visibility for potential threats through dashboards

The architecture is containerized using **Docker** to simplify deployment and ensure modularity.

## üì¶ Stack Components

| Component | Role |
|----------|------|
| **Wazuh Manager** | Collects and analyzes endpoint logs |
| **Wazuh Agent** (Windows) | Installed on the endpoint (Sysmon used for event logging) |
| **Wazuh Dashboard** | Visualizes alerts |
| **Logstash** | Filters and transforms Wazuh alerts, enriches them with MISP IoCs |
| **MISP** | Stores and serves threat intelligence (IoCs, events, attributes) |
| **Docker** | Containerizes and orchestrates the full environment |

## üß† Why Sysmon is Essential

**Sysmon (System Monitor)** is a crucial component in this stack. It is responsible for collecting detailed event logs from the Windows endpoint ‚Äî including process creation, network connections, registry changes, and file modifications ‚Äî which are then analyzed by Wazuh.

Without Sysmon, you won‚Äôt capture rich behavioral data necessary for meaningful threat detection and enrichment.

## üèÅ Installing Sysmon on Windows

1. Download Sysmon from the official [Sysinternals site](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon)
2. Download a configuration file (you can use [SwiftOnSecurity's sysmon-config](https://github.com/SwiftOnSecurity/sysmon-config) or write your own)
3. Open CMD as Administrator and run:

```cmd
sysmon64.exe -accepteula -i sysmonconfig.xml


Access components:

Wazuh Dashboard ‚Üí https://localhost:5601
admin:SecretPassword

MISP Web UI ‚Üí https://localhost:8443
admin@admin.test:admin

Logstash is headless and runs in the background
